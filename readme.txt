brainwhack (wip)

Brainfuck to C translator and interpreter.

to try interpreter do `make interpreter`, if you want to generate C file do `make codegen`.

in case it doesn't work or there's a bug open an issue and include BF source code, or DM me. 
if you would like to contribute (god bless your soul) i'm down of course.
if you find something that can needs to be improved code wise just DM me (there's a lot of
stuff to be improved, some of the more obvious i'm probably already working on).
